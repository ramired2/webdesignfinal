                <p class="briefing">For any individual their community is a large part of who they are, it helps shape most of their
                    thoughts and ideals. In essense, it is the basis for who the person will become in the future. This is not always the case,
                    however, it still maintains an integral part for any person. As such, for the deaf and hard of hearing, having and being invovled
                    in the deaf community is an important part of themselves. While the deaf community does include the deaf and hard of hearing
                    not all deaf and hard of hearing individuals align themselves to the community. Some may choose to distance themselves from
                    the community. Moreover, the deaf community does not solely include the hard of hearing of the deaf, it also includes family members
                    from these individuals or sign language interpreters that align themselves to the community. 
                </p>
            
                <p class="briefing">Without having this support group from the deaf community, some members may feel alienated or lost. In such cases,
                    being part of a community can help increase self-esteem and help with the growth and memorization of ASL if they are not fluent or 
                    if they feel embarassed to use it.
