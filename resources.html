                <p class="briefing">Accessibility to information about deafness is an integral part in helping to
                    understand this large community of people. It is one thing to 
                    simply know and live with the knowledge that deaf people exist, however,
                    knowing about what issues they face that hearing people take for granted
                    or have never even thought about could bring about a variety of ideas to
                    make public spaces more deaf friendly. As such, here are some important resources. This can be helpful to both 
                    hearing and non-hearing individuals.
